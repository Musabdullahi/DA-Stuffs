# *Project Title: SuperSales Analysis*
In this analysis, I will be using Microsoft Excel to analyse, visualize and draw insights from the Superstore Dataset publicly obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final). The SuperStore dataset spans a period of Four (4) years.

Power Query from Excel was utilized to clean and transform the data to address:  
* Duplicate values.
* Missing values or errors.
* Inconsistencies in datatype.
* Inconsistencies in date formats.
